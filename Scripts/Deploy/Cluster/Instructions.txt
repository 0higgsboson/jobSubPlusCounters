Follow these steps to set up Hadoop Cluster
1- Set up ssh keys, master node should have ssh access to itself and to all worker nodes
2.1- Make sure the cluster hosts are reachable using host name.  If not, append the /etc/hosts file
2- Create a hosts file, first node will be treated as master node.  Use host names instead of ip addresses
3- Change configurations.sh file as per your requirements
4- Run: ./install-all.sh hosts_file

5- Clean up if the installer doesn't go all the way through:  If there are any hadoop daemons running (jps), kill them.  Then delete /root/cluster & /root/scripts.  Then reinstall.
