Follow these steps to set up Hadoop Cluster
1- Set up ssh keys, master node should have ssh access to itself and to all nodes where sherpa client is going to be installed
2- Create a hosts file, sherpa clients will be installed on all those nodes
3- Change configurations.sh file as per your requirements. Set hadoop settings

    As per Hadoop version comment/un-comment following settings, pick only one set of definition

    # For Hadoop 2.7.1
    #-------------------------
    HADOOP_VERSION=2.7.1
    ACTIVE_PROFILE=H2.7.1
    MR_REPO_URL=https://github.com/0higgsboson/hadoop2.7.git
    SRC_DIR=hadoop2.7


    # For Hadoop 2.6.0
    #-------------------------
    #HADOOP_VERSION=2.6.0
    #activeProfile=H2.6
    #MR_REPO_URL=https://github.com/0higgsboson/mrClient.git
    #SRC_DIR=mrClient


    Update base path where to install client code
    installation_base_dir=/root/sherpa


    Change to no, if client agent installation is not required
    client_agent_install=yes

    host name of client agent
    client_agent_host=test-w2

    Change to no, if tenzing installation is not required
    tenzing_install=yes

    # hostname where to install tenzing
    tenzing_host=test-w1


4- Edit sherpa.properties file and update settings  (This file would be created by script, its on task list)

5- Run sherpa_installer in the sequence below:
        ./sherpa_installer package [2.7.1]  -- Packages CA & Client installers for customers
            Extract tar file to which ever node you want to install MR and hive cts.
                Then run the client isntaller.sh
            Extract tar file to which ever node you want to install CA on, not a random node / NN.
                There are two shell scripts.
                    one for tomcat
                    second for CA.
        ./sherpa_installer tenzing  [2.7.1] -- Packages Tenzing
            Extract tar file to which ever node you want to install CA on, not a random node / NN.
                There are two shell scripts.
                    one for tomcat
                    second for Tenzing.

6. Update the following env settings to hadoop-env.sh
        exportÂ HADOOP_USER_CLASSPATH_FIRST=true
        export HADOOP_CLASSPATH=/opt/sherpa/lib/*:$HADOOP_CLASSPATH
