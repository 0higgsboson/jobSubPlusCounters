Follow these steps to set up Hadoop Cluster
1- Set up ssh keys, master node should have ssh access to itself and to all nodes where sherpa client is going to be installed
2- Create a hosts file, sherpa clients will be installed on all those nodes
3- Change configurations.sh file as per your requirements. Set hadoop settings

    As per Hadoop version comment/un-comment following settings, pick only one set of definition

    # For Hadoop 2.7.1
    #-------------------------
    HADOOP_VERSION=2.7.1
    ACTIVE_PROFILE=H2.7.1
    MR_REPO_URL=https://github.com/0higgsboson/hadoop2.7.git
    SRC_DIR=hadoop2.7


    # For Hadoop 2.6.0
    #-------------------------
    #HADOOP_VERSION=2.6.0
    #activeProfile=H2.6
    #MR_REPO_URL=https://github.com/0higgsboson/mrClient.git
    #SRC_DIR=mrClient


    Update base path where to install client code
    installation_base_dir=/root/sherpa


    Change to no, if client agent installation is not required
    client_agent_install=yes

    host name of client agent
    client_agent_host=test-w2

    Change to no, if tenzing installation is not required
    tenzing_install=yes

    # hostname where to install tenzing
    tenzing_host=test-w1


4- Edit sherpa.properties file and update settings  (This file would be created by script, its on task list)
5- Place executable jar file for Client Agent ( default name TzCtCommon-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar )
6- Place executable jar file for Tenzing ( default name TzCtCommon-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar )
7- a) Install Sherpa Clients By:  ./sherpa_multinode_installer.sh host_file
   b) Install Tenzing By: ./tenzing_installer.sh
   c) Install CA By       ./client-agent_installer.sh

   Please Install in the order specified
